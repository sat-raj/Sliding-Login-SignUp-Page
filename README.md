# Sliding-Login-SignUp-Page
The "Elegant Sliding Sign-In and Registration Interface" is a web project that aims to provide users with a visually appealing and intuitive experience when signing in or registering on a website. This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create smooth sliding animations and a modern design.

##Feartures
###Sliding Panels: 
The project consists of two main panels: the sign-in panel and the registration panel. These panels are designed to slide horizontally, providing a seamless transition between sign-in and registration.

###Interactive Design: 
The interface incorporates interactive elements, such as buttons, input fields, and icons, which respond to user interactions. Hover effects, subtle animations, and transitions enhance the user experience.

###Form Validation: 
JavaScript is used to implement form validation. Real-time feedback is provided to users when they input incorrect or incomplete data, helping them correct mistakes before submitting the form.
